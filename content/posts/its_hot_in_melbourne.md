Melbourne just experienced a scorching day with temperatures peaking at 43 degrees Celsius (109°F). The hot winds brought sweltering conditions across the city, wreaking havoc and reminding everyone why summer in Australia is no joke.

While many people rush indoors to escape the heat, I actually find myself enjoying these extreme weather days – especially when I'm out riding my bike. There's something memorable about pushing through the warm air, feeling the hot breeze against your face, and experiencing the city in its most intense summer state.

Sure, it's uncomfortable at times, and you definitely need to stay hydrated and take precautions. But there's an energy to these hot days that's uniquely Melbourne. The way the heat shimmers off the pavement, the quieter streets as people seek shelter, and the sense of accomplishment when you complete a ride in these conditions – these are the moments that stick with you.

Days like this become part of your story, part of what makes living through Melbourne's wild weather swings something to remember. When winter rolls around and we're bundled up in layers, I'll look back on this 43-degree day and smile, knowing I was out there experiencing it all.
